Description: Identify equivalences of NAICS codes across various releases. New 
    NAICS codes have been released every 5 years since 1997, and the US Census
    maintains records of code descriptions by year and crosswalk tables between
    successive years. This package automates lookups in those tables to build
    equivalences across different releases.
