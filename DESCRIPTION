Description: Provide crosswalks to simplify the temporal alignment of SOC and
    NAICS codes. SOC codes have been released in 2000, 2010, and 2018, and NAICS
    codes have been released every 5 years since 1997. BLS and Census (for SOC
    and NAICS, respectively) maintain reference data on code descriptions by 
    release and concordances tables between successive releases. This package 
    provides these tables as data objects, and automates conversions between 
    years using the crosswalks.
